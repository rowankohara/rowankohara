### Welcome

Hello, my name is Rowan K. O'Hara-Payne. I am a second-year Epidemiology & Human Genetics PhD student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, studying psychiatric genetics in Dr. Seth Ament's lab. I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) with Bachelors degrees in Bioinformatics and Psychology and a Masters degree in Bioinformatics. My Masters thesis [work](https://rowankohara.github.io/projects.html#womens-health-research-day) at the POP-GEM Lab was examining cross-ancestry phenotypic and genetic associations with major depression and determining if interpersonal violence exposure is correlated with depression symptoms and if these associations vary by sex. Previously, I worked as an intern at the National Cancer Institute at the NIH as a part of the Graduate Data Science Summer Program. My [work](https://rowankohara.github.io/projects.html#nih-summer-poster-day) focused on cancer genetics and bioinformatics, particularly using machine learning to genotype the *TERT* MNS16A polymorphic minisatellite.
